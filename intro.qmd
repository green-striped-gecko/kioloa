# Session 1: Introduction to DArTSeq

## Sequencing

![](images/tuc_lecture.png){fig-align="left"}

Diversity Arrays Technology Pty Ltd (DArT) is a private company that specializes in genotyping by sequencing. Their approach is one of genome complexity reduction. But what does this mean? Basically, DArTSeq is a method that extracts reproducible genomic variation across the genomes of many individuals at an affordable cost. The technique digests genomic DNA using pairs of restriction enzymes (cutters) (Figure 1). When the DNA is cut at two locations within a reasonable distance of each other, the fragment is available for sequencing using the Illumina short-read platforms. Hence, the data are representational in the sense that they are generated for a random but reproducible selection of small fragments of sequence only, fragments that exhibit variation at the level of single base pairs (SNPs). The first step in the process involves the selection of restriction enzymes that provide the best balance between getting adequate fraction of the genome represented, an adequate read depth for each fragment, and adequate levels of polymorphism. This is species specific and so requires some initial optimization.
