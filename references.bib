	abstract = {Although vast technological advances have been made and genetic software packages are growing in number, it is not a trivial task to analyse SNP data. We announce a new R package, DARTR, enabling the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data for population genomic and phylogenomic applications. DARTR provides user-friendly functions for data quality control and marker selection, and permits rigorous evaluations of conformation to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, gametic-phase disequilibrium and neutrality. The package reports standard descriptive statistics, permits exploration of patterns in the data through principal components analysis and conducts standard F-statistics, as well as basic phylogenetic analyses, population assignment, isolation by distance and exports data to a variety of commonly used downstream applications (e.g., NEWHYBRIDS, FASTSTRUCTURE and phylogeny applications) outside of the R environment. The package serves two main purposes: first, a user-friendly approach to lower the hurdle to analyse such data—therefore, the package comes with a detailed tutorial targeted to the R beginner to allow data analysis without requiring deep knowledge of R. Second, we use a single, well-established format—genlight from the ADEGENET package—as input for all our functions to avoid data reformatting. By strictly using the genlight format, we hope to facilitate this format as the de facto standard of future software developments and hence reduce the format jungle of genetic data sets. The DARTR package is available via the R CRAN network and GitHub.},

	abstract = {Innumerable approaches to analyse genetic data are now available to guide conservation, ecological and agricultural projects. However, streamlined and accessible tools are needed to bring these approaches within the reach of a broader user base. dartR was released in 2018 to lessen the intrinsic complexity of analysing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and dominant markers (presence/absence of amplified sequence tags) by providing user-friendly data quality control and marker selection functions. dartR users have grown steadily since its release and provided valuable feedback on their interaction with the package allowing us to enhance dartR capabilities. Here, we present Version 2 of dartR. In this version, we substantially increased the number of available functions from 45 to 144. In addition to improved functionality, we focused on enhancing the user experience by extending plot customisation, function standardisation, increasing user support and function speed. dartR provides functions for various stages in analysing genetic data, from data manipulation to reporting. dartR provides many functions for importing, exporting and linking to other packages, to provide an easy-to-navigate conduit between data generation and analysis options already available via other packages. We also implemented simulation functions whose results can be analysed seamlessly with several other dartR functions. As more methods and approaches mature to inform conservation, we envision that accessible platforms to analyse genetic data will play a crucial role in translating science into practice.},

	abstract = {Identifying sex-linked markers in genomic datasets is important because their presence in supposedly neutral autosomal datasets can result in incorrect estimates of genetic diversity, population structure and parentage. However, detecting sex-linked loci can be challenging, and available scripts neglect some categories of sex-linked variation. Here, we present new R functions to (1) identify and separate sex-linked loci in ZW and XY sex determination systems and (2) infer the genetic sex of individuals based on these loci. We tested these functions on genomic data for two bird and one mammal species and compared the biological inferences made before and after removing sex-linked loci using our function. We found that our function identified autosomal loci with ≥98.8\% accuracy and sex-linked loci with an average accuracy of 87.8\%. We showed that standard filters, such as low read depth and call rate, failed to remove up to 54.7\% of sex-linked loci. This led to (i) overestimation of population FIS by up to 24\%, and the number of private alleles by up to 8\%; (ii) wrongly inferring significant sex differences in heterozygosity; (iii) obscuring genetic population structure and (iv) inferring 11\% fewer correct parentages. We discuss how failure to remove sex-linked markers can lead to incorrect biological inferences (e.g. sex-biased dispersal and cryptic population structure) and misleading management recommendations. For reduced-representation datasets with at least 15 known-sex individuals of each sex, our functions offer convenient resources to remove sex-linked loci and to sex the remaining individuals (freely available at https://github.com/drobledoruiz/conservation\_genomics).},

	abstract = {When closely related species come into contact via range expansion, both may experience reduced fitness as a result of the interaction. Selection is expected to favour traits that minimize costly interspecies reproductive interactions (such as mismating) via a phenomenon called reproductive character displacement (RCD). Research on RCD frequently assumes secondary contact between species, but the geographical history of species interactions is often unknown. Population genomic data permit tests of geographical hypotheses about species origins and secondary contact through range expansion. We used population genomic data from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mitochondrial sequence data, advertisement call data and morphological data to investigate a species complex of toadlets (Uperoleia borealis, U. crassa, U. inundata) from northern Australia. Although the three species of frogs were morphologically indistinguishable in our analysis, we determined that U. crassa and U. inundata form a single species (synonymized here) based on an absence of genomic divergence. SNP data identified the phylogeographical origin of U. crassa as the Top End, with subsequent westward invasion into the range of U. borealis in the Kimberley. We identified six F1 hybrids, all of which had the U. borealis mitochondrial haplotype, suggesting unidirectional hybridization. Consistent with the RCD hypothesis, U. borealis and U. crassa sexual signals differ more in sympatry than in allopatry. Hybrid males have intermediate calls, which probably reduces attractiveness to females. Integrating population genomic data, mitochondrial sequencing, morphology and behavioural approaches provides an unusually detailed collection of evidence for reproductive character displacement following range expansion and secondary contact.},

	abstract = {With up to millions of nearly neutral polymorphisms now being routinely sampled in population-genomic surveys, it is possible to estimate the site-frequency spectrum of such sites with high precision. Each frequency class reflects a mixture of potentially unique demographic histories, which can be revealed using theory for the probability distributions of the starting and ending points of branch segments over all possible coalescence trees. Such distributions are completely independent of past population history, which only influences the segment lengths, providing the basis for estimating average population sizes separating tree-wide coalescence events. The history of population-size change experienced by a sample of polymorphisms can then be dissected in a model-flexible fashion, and extension of this theory allows estimation of the mean and full distribution of long-term effective population sizes and ages of alleles of specific frequencies. Here, we outline the basic theory underlying the conceptual approach, develop and test an efficient statistical procedure for parameter estimation, and apply this to multiple population-genomic datasets for the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex.},
