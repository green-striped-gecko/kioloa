	abstract = {Although vast technological advances have been made and genetic software packages are growing in number, it is not a trivial task to analyse SNP data. We announce a new R package, DARTR, enabling the analysis of single nucleotide polymorphism data for population genomic and phylogenomic applications. DARTR provides user-friendly functions for data quality control and marker selection, and permits rigorous evaluations of conformation to Hardy–Weinberg equilibrium, gametic-phase disequilibrium and neutrality. The package reports standard descriptive statistics, permits exploration of patterns in the data through principal components analysis and conducts standard F-statistics, as well as basic phylogenetic analyses, population assignment, isolation by distance and exports data to a variety of commonly used downstream applications (e.g., NEWHYBRIDS, FASTSTRUCTURE and phylogeny applications) outside of the R environment. The package serves two main purposes: first, a user-friendly approach to lower the hurdle to analyse such data—therefore, the package comes with a detailed tutorial targeted to the R beginner to allow data analysis without requiring deep knowledge of R. Second, we use a single, well-established format—genlight from the ADEGENET package—as input for all our functions to avoid data reformatting. By strictly using the genlight format, we hope to facilitate this format as the de facto standard of future software developments and hence reduce the format jungle of genetic data sets. The DARTR package is available via the R CRAN network and GitHub.},

	abstract = {Innumerable approaches to analyse genetic data are now available to guide conservation, ecological and agricultural projects. However, streamlined and accessible tools are needed to bring these approaches within the reach of a broader user base. dartR was released in 2018 to lessen the intrinsic complexity of analysing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and dominant markers (presence/absence of amplified sequence tags) by providing user-friendly data quality control and marker selection functions. dartR users have grown steadily since its release and provided valuable feedback on their interaction with the package allowing us to enhance dartR capabilities. Here, we present Version 2 of dartR. In this version, we substantially increased the number of available functions from 45 to 144. In addition to improved functionality, we focused on enhancing the user experience by extending plot customisation, function standardisation, increasing user support and function speed. dartR provides functions for various stages in analysing genetic data, from data manipulation to reporting. dartR provides many functions for importing, exporting and linking to other packages, to provide an easy-to-navigate conduit between data generation and analysis options already available via other packages. We also implemented simulation functions whose results can be analysed seamlessly with several other dartR functions. As more methods and approaches mature to inform conservation, we envision that accessible platforms to analyse genetic data will play a crucial role in translating science into practice.},

	abstract = {Identifying sex-linked markers in genomic datasets is important because their presence in supposedly neutral autosomal datasets can result in incorrect estimates of genetic diversity, population structure and parentage. However, detecting sex-linked loci can be challenging, and available scripts neglect some categories of sex-linked variation. Here, we present new R functions to (1) identify and separate sex-linked loci in ZW and XY sex determination systems and (2) infer the genetic sex of individuals based on these loci. We tested these functions on genomic data for two bird and one mammal species and compared the biological inferences made before and after removing sex-linked loci using our function. We found that our function identified autosomal loci with ≥98.8\% accuracy and sex-linked loci with an average accuracy of 87.8\%. We showed that standard filters, such as low read depth and call rate, failed to remove up to 54.7\% of sex-linked loci. This led to (i) overestimation of population FIS by up to 24\%, and the number of private alleles by up to 8\%; (ii) wrongly inferring significant sex differences in heterozygosity; (iii) obscuring genetic population structure and (iv) inferring 11\% fewer correct parentages. We discuss how failure to remove sex-linked markers can lead to incorrect biological inferences (e.g. sex-biased dispersal and cryptic population structure) and misleading management recommendations. For reduced-representation datasets with at least 15 known-sex individuals of each sex, our functions offer convenient resources to remove sex-linked loci and to sex the remaining individuals (freely available at https://github.com/drobledoruiz/conservation\_genomics).},

	abstract = {When closely related species come into contact via range expansion, both may experience reduced fitness as a result of the interaction. Selection is expected to favour traits that minimize costly interspecies reproductive interactions (such as mismating) via a phenomenon called reproductive character displacement (RCD). Research on RCD frequently assumes secondary contact between species, but the geographical history of species interactions is often unknown. Population genomic data permit tests of geographical hypotheses about species origins and secondary contact through range expansion. We used population genomic data from single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), mitochondrial sequence data, advertisement call data and morphological data to investigate a species complex of toadlets (Uperoleia borealis, U. crassa, U. inundata) from northern Australia. Although the three species of frogs were morphologically indistinguishable in our analysis, we determined that U. crassa and U. inundata form a single species (synonymized here) based on an absence of genomic divergence. SNP data identified the phylogeographical origin of U. crassa as the Top End, with subsequent westward invasion into the range of U. borealis in the Kimberley. We identified six F1 hybrids, all of which had the U. borealis mitochondrial haplotype, suggesting unidirectional hybridization. Consistent with the RCD hypothesis, U. borealis and U. crassa sexual signals differ more in sympatry than in allopatry. Hybrid males have intermediate calls, which probably reduces attractiveness to females. Integrating population genomic data, mitochondrial sequencing, morphology and behavioural approaches provides an unusually detailed collection of evidence for reproductive character displacement following range expansion and secondary contact.},

Each frequency class reflects a mixture of potentially unique demographic histories, which can be revealed using theory for the probability distributions of the starting and ending points of branch segments over all possible coalescence trees. Such distributions are completely independent of past population history, which only influences the segment lengths, providing the basis for estimating average population sizes separating tree-wide coalescence events. The history of population-size change experienced by a sample of polymorphisms can then be dissected in a model-flexible fashion, and extension of this theory allows estimation of the mean and full distribution of long-term effective population sizes and ages of alleles of specific frequencies. Here, we outline the basic theory underlying the conceptual approach, develop and test an efficient statistical procedure for parameter estimation, and apply this to multiple population-genomic datasets for the microcrustacean Daphnia pulex.},

	abstract = {The Bull Shark (Carcharhinus leucas) faces varying levels of exploitation around the world due to its coastal distribution. Information regarding population connectivity is crucial to evaluate its conservation status and local fishing impacts. In this study, we sampled 922 putative Bull Sharks from 19 locations in the first global assessment of population structure of this cosmopolitan species. Using a recently developed DNA‐capture approach (DArTcap), samples were genotyped for 3400 nuclear markers. Additionally, full mitochondrial genomes of 384 Indo‐Pacific samples were sequenced. Reproductive isolation was found between and across ocean basins (eastern Pacific, western Atlantic, eastern Atlantic, Indo‐West Pacific) with distinct island populations in Japan and Fiji. Bull Sharks appear to maintain gene flow using shallow coastal waters as dispersal corridors, whereas large oceanic distances and historical land‐bridges act as barriers. Females tend to return to the same area for reproduction, making them more susceptible to local threats and an important focus for management actions. Given these behaviors, the exploitation of Bull Sharks from insular populations, such as Japan and Fiji, may instigate local decline that cannot readily be replenished by immigration, which can in turn affect ecosystem dynamics and functions. These data also supported the development of a genetic panel to ascertain the population of origin, which will be useful in monitoring the trade of fisheries products and assessing population‐level impacts of this harvest., In this study, 922 putative Bull Sharks were obtained from 19 locations for the first global assessment of population structure of this cosmopolitan coastal species. Nuclear DNA identified distinct populations in each ocean basin, with distinct island populations in Japan and Fiji. While nuclear DNA indicated that the Indo‐West Pacific is well‐connected, mitochondrial DNA—only inherited from the mother—showed that females return to the same locations for breeding.},

It is classified as Critically Endangered in the Mediterranean Sea, and Near Threatened globally. Previous genetic studies did not reject the null hypothesis of a single global population. The blue shark was proposed as a possible archetype of the “grey zone of population differentiation,” coined to designate cases where population structure may be too recent or too faint to be detected using a limited set of markers. Here, blue shark samples collected throughout its global range were sequenced using a specific RAD method (DArTseq), which recovered 37,655 genome-wide single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Two main groups emerged, with Mediterranean Sea and northern Atlantic samples (Northern population) differentiated significantly from the Indo-west Pacific samples (Southern population). Significant pairwise FST values indicated further genetic differentiation within the Atlantic Ocean, and between the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Reconstruction of recent demographic history suggested divergence between Northern and Southern populations occurred about 500 generations ago and revealed a drastic reduction in effective population size from a large ancestral population. Our results illustrate the power of genome scans to detect population structure and reconstruct demographic history in highly migratory marine species. Given that the management plans of the blue shark (targeted or bycatch) fisheries currently assume panmictic regional stocks, we strongly recommend that the results presented here be considered in future stock assessments and conservation strategies.},

	abstract = {Genetic diversity is frequently described using heterozygosity, particularly in a conservation context. Often, it is estimated using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs); however, it has been shown that heterozygosity values calculated from SNPs can be biased by both study design and filtering parameters. Though solutions have been proposed to address these issues, our own work has found them to be inadequate in some circumstances. Here, we aimed to improve the reliability and comparability of heterozygosity estimates, specifically by investigating how sample size and missing data thresholds influenced the calculation of autosomal heterozygosity (heterozygosity calculated from across the genome, i.e. fixed and variable sites). We also explored how the standard practice of tri- and tetra-allelic site exclusion could bias heterozygosity estimates and influence eventual conclusions relating to genetic diversity. Across three distinct taxa (a frog, Litoria rubella; a tree, Eucalyptus microcarpa; and a grasshopper, Keyacris scurra), we found heterozygosity estimates to be meaningfully affected by sample size and missing data thresholds, partly due to the exclusion of tri- and tetra-allelic sites. These biases were inconsistent both between species and populations, with more diverse populations tending to have their estimates more severely affected, thus having potential to dramatically alter interpretations of genetic diversity. We propose a modified framework for calculating heterozygosity that reduces bias and improves the utility of heterozygosity as a measure of genetic diversity, whilst also highlighting the need for existing population genetic pipelines to be adjusted such that tri- and tetra-allelic sites be included in calculations.},

	abstract = {Geographic genetic differentiation measures are used for purposes such as assessing genetic diversity and connectivity, and searching for signals of selection. Confirmation by unrelated measures can minimize false positives. A popular differentiation measure, Bray-Curtis, has been used increasingly in molecular ecology, renamed AFD (hereafter called BCAFD). Critically, BCAFD is expected to be partially independent of the commonly used Hill “Q-profile” measures. BCAFD needs scrutiny for potential biases, by examining limits on its value, and comparing simulations against expectations. BCAFD has two dependencies on within-population (alpha) variation, undesirable for a between-population (beta) measure. The first dependency is derived from similarity to GST and FST. The second dependency is that BCAFD cannot be larger than the highest allele proportion in either location (alpha variation), which can be overcome by data-filtering or by a modified statistic AA or “Adjusted AFD”. The first dependency does not forestall applications such as assessing connectivity or selection, if we know the measure's null behavior under selective neutrality with specified conditions—which is shown in this article for AA, for equilibrium, and nonequilibrium, for the commonly used data type of single-nucleotide-polymorphisms (SNPs) in two locations. Thus, AA can be used in tandem with mathematically contrasting differentiation measures, with the aim of reducing false inferences. For detecting adaptive loci, the relative performance of AA and other measures was evaluated, showing that it is best to use two mathematically different measures simultaneously, and that AA is in one of the best such pairwise criteria. For any application, using AA, rather than BCAFD, avoids the counterintuitive limitation by maximum allele proportion within localities.},

	abstract = {This study provides predictive equations for Shannon’s information in a finite population, which are intuitive and simple enough to see wide scale use in molecular ecology and population genetics. A comprehensive profile of genetic diversity contains three complementary components: numbers of allelic types, Shannon’s information and heterozygosity. Currently heterozygosity has greater resources than Shannon’s information, such as more predictive models and integration into more mainstream genetics software. However, Shannon’s information has several advantages over heterozygosity as a measure of genetic diversity, so it is important to develop Shannon’s information as a new tool for molecular ecology. Past efforts at making forecasts for Shannon’s information in specific molecular ecology scenarios mostly dealt with expectations for Shannon’s information at genetic equilibrium, but dynamic forecasts are also vital. In particular, we must be able to predict loss of genetic diversity when dealing with finite populations, because they risk losing genetic variability, which can have an adverse effect on their survival. We present equations for predicting loss of genetic diversity measured by Shannon’s information. We also provide statistical justification for these models by assessing their fit to data derived from simulations and managed, replicated laboratory populations. The predictive models will enhance the usefulness of Shannon’s information as a measure of genetic diversity; they will also be useful in pest control and conservation.},

Populations have declined by 80\% since 1996 due to a contagious cancer, devil facial tumor disease (DFTD). However, predicted local extinctions have not occurred. Recent suggestions of selection for "resistance" alleles in the wild precipitated concerns that insurance population devils may be unsuitable for translocations. Using 830 wild samples collected at 31 locations between 2012 and 2021, and 553 insurance metapopulation devils, we show that the insurance metapopulation is representative of current wild genetic diversity. Allele frequencies at DFTD-associated loci were not substantially different between captive and wild devils.

Although there is strong evidence to suggest that chromosome rearrangements are a factor in genetic isolation of divergent populations, the underlying mechanism remains elusive. Here, we applied an integrative cytogenetics and genomics approach testing whether chromosomal rearrangements are the initial process, or a consequence, of population divergence in the dwarf goanna, Varanus acanthurus. Specifically, we tested whether chromosome rearrangements are indicators of genetic barriers that can be used to identify divergent populations by looking at gene flow within and between populations with rearrangements. We found that gene flow was present between individuals with chromosome rearrangements within populations, but there was no gene flow between populations that had similar chromosome rearrangements. Moreover, we identified a correlation between reduced genetic variation in populations with a higher frequency of homozygous submetacentric individuals. These findings suggest that chromosomal rearrangements were widespread prior to divergence, and because we found populations with higher frequencies of submetacentric chromosomes were associated with lower genetic diversity, this could indicate that polymorphisms within populations are early indicators of genetic drift.},

Rearrangements alter the genomic structure and interfere with homologous recombination by isolating a portion of the genome. Integration of multiplatform next-generation DNA sequencing technologies has enabled putative identification of chromosome rearrangements in many taxa; however, integrating these data sets with cytogenetics is still uncommon beyond model genetic organisms. Therefore, to achieve the ultimate goal for the genomic classification of eukaryotic organisms, physical chromosome mapping remains critical. The ridge-tailed goannas (Varanus acanthurus BOULENGER) are a group of dwarf monitor lizards comprised of several species found throughout northern Australia. These lizards exhibit extreme divergence at both the genic and chromosomal levels. The chromosome polymorphisms are widespread extending across much of their distribution, raising the question if these polymorphisms are homologous within the V. acanthurus complex. We used a combined genomic and cytogenetic approach to test for homology across divergent populations with morphologically similar chromosome rearrangements. We showed that more than one chromosome pair was involved with the widespread rearrangements. This finding provides evidence to support de novo chromosome rearrangements have occurred within populations. These chromosome rearrangements are characterized by fixed allele differences originating in the vicinity of the centromeric region. We then compared this region with several other assembled genomes of reptiles, chicken, and the platypus. We demonstrated that the synteny of genes in Reptilia remains conserved despite centromere repositioning across these taxa.},

One aspect of the program is the ongoing removal of resident and immigrant crocodiles within Darwin Harbor (since 1979), the main urban center. We determined the likely sources of crocodiles caught as problem animals between 2015–2017 by comparing recently developed methods for population assignment. Depending on the assignment model used, we estimated that between 30\% and 50\% of crocodiles in Darwin Harbor originated from the Adelaide and Mary rivers, and the Kakadu region east of Darwin, and between 20\% and 30\% of crocodiles originated from the Finniss, Reynolds, and Daly rivers southwest of Darwin. Saltwater crocodiles occur at particularly high densities in these catchments. The remainder came from a mixture of different sources across the Northern Territory. The most common animals captured were immature (150–180 cm) males that have traveled 100–200 km. We did not identify any relationships between the distance from the inferred origin to Darwin Harbor and the size and sex of the crocodiles, or the year of capture. The targeted removal of crocodiles from specific sites such as Darwin Harbor, near where most people live, improves public safety in the highest risk areas, without compromising abundant source populations in most areas.},

We integrated satellite-derived surface water data and population genomic diversity from 20,294 single-nucleotide polymorphisms across 344 individuals to understand metapopulation persistence of the desert rainbowfish (Melanotaenia splendida tatei) in central Australia. Desert rainbowfish showed very small effective population sizes, especially at peripheral populations, and low connectivity between river catchments. Yet, there was no evidence of population-level inbreeding and a signal of possible adaptive divergence associated with aridity was detected. Candidate genes for local adaptation included functions related to environmental cues and stressful conditions. Eco-evolutionary modeling showed that positive selection in refugial subpopulations combined with connectivity during flood periods can enable retention of adaptive diversity. Our study suggests that adaptive variation can be maintained in small populations and integrate with neutral metapopulation processes to allow persistence in the desert.},

The new era of whole genome sequencing provides new opportunities and avenues to explore the role of genetic variants in the plasticity of immune responses, particularly in non-model systems. Cetacean morbillivirus (CeMV) has emerged as a major viral threat to cetacean populations worldwide, contributing to the death of thousands of individuals of multiple dolphin and whale species. To understand the genomic basis of immune responses to CeMV, we generated and analysed whole genomes of 53 Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) exposed to Australia's largest known CeMV-related mortality event that killed at least 50 dolphins from three different species. The genomic data set consisted of 10,168,981 SNPs anchored onto 23 chromosome-length scaffolds and 77 short scaffolds. Whole genome analysis indicated that levels of inbreeding in the dolphin population did not influence the outcome of an individual. Allele frequency estimates between survivors and nonsurvivors of the outbreak revealed 15,769 candidate SNPs, of which 689 were annotated to 295 protein coding genes. These included 50 genes with functions related to innate and adaptive immune responses, and cytokine signalling pathways and genes thought to be involved in immune responses to other morbilliviruses. Our study characterised genomic regions and pathways that may contribute to CeMV immune responses in dolphins. This represents a stride towards clarifying the complex interactions of the cetacean immune system and emphasises the value of whole genome data sets in understanding genetic elements that are essential for species conservation, including disease susceptibility and adaptation.},

Latitudinal gradients allow testing general ecosystem-level theories relevant to climatic adaptation. We assessed differences in adaptive diversity of populations along a latitudinal region spanning highly variable temperate to subtropical climates. We generated and integrated information from environmental mapping, phenotypic variation and genome-wide data from across the geographical range of the rainbowfish Melanotaenia duboulayi, an emerging aquatic system for studies of climate change. We detected, after controlling for spatial population structure, strong interactions between genotypes and environment associated with variation in stream flow and temperature. Some of these hydroclimate-associated genes were found to interact within functional protein networks that contain genes of adaptive significance for projected future climates in rainbowfish. Hydroclimatic selection was also associated with variation in phenotypic traits, including traits known to affect fitness of rainbowfish exposed to different flow environments. Consistent with predictions from the "climatic variability hypothesis," populations exposed to extremes of important environmental variables showed stronger adaptive divergence and less variation in climate-associated genes compared to populations at the centre of the environmental gradient. Our findings suggest that populations that evolved at environmental range margins and at geographical range edges may be more vulnerable to changing climates, a finding with implications for predicting adaptive resilience and managing biodiversity under climate change.},

We estimated environmental niche models and genomic vulnerability for closely related species of rainbowfish (Melanotaenia spp.) across an elevational gradient in the Australian Wet Tropics. Hybrid populations between a widespread generalist and several narrow range endemic species exhibited reduced vulnerability to projected climates compared to pure narrow endemics. Overlaps between introgressed and adaptive genomic regions were consistent with a signal of adaptive introgression. Our findings highlight the often-underappreciated conservation value of hybrid populations and indicate that adaptive introgression may contribute to evolutionary rescue of species with narrow environmental ranges.},

However, these influences might also extend to species characterized by strong social structure, natal philopatry and small home ranges. We implemented a seascape genomic study to test this hypothesis in Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphins (Tursiops aduncus) distributed along the environmentally heterogeneous coast of southern Australia. The data sets included oceanographic and environmental variables thought to be good predictors of local adaptation in dolphins and 8081 filtered single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) genotyped for individuals sampled from seven different bioregions. From a neutral perspective, population structure and connectivity of the dolphins were generally influenced by habitat type and social structuring. Genotype-environment association analysis identified 241 candidate adaptive loci and revealed that sea surface temperature and salinity gradients influenced adaptive divergence in these animals at both large- (1000 km) and fine-scales ({\textless}100 km). Enrichment analysis and annotation of candidate genes revealed functions related to sodium-activated ion transport, kidney development, adipogenesis and thermogenesis. The findings of spatial adaptive divergence and inferences of putative physiological adaptations challenge previous suggestions that marine megafauna is most likely to be affected by environmental and climatic changes via indirect, trophic effects.

We assessed how its population structure has been influenced by environmental heterogeneity along a zonal coastal boundary in southern Australia linked by strong oceanographic connectivity. Our data sets include 9,109 filtered SNPs for 371 abalones from 13 localities and environmental mapping across {\textasciitilde}800 km. Genotype-environment association analyses and outlier tests defined 8,786 putatively neutral and 323 candidate adaptive loci. From a neutral perspective, the species is better represented by a metapopulation with very low differentiation (global FST  = 0.0081) and weak isolation by distance following a stepping-stone model. For the candidate adaptive loci, however, model-based and model-free approaches indicated five divergent population clusters. After controlling for spatial distance, the distribution of putatively adaptive variation was strongly correlated to selection linked to minimum sea surface temperature and oxygen concentration. Around 80 candidates were annotated to genes with functions related to high temperature and/or low oxygen tolerance, including genes that influence the resilience of abalone species found in other biogeographic regions. Our study includes a documented example about the uptake of genomic information in fisheries management and supports the hypothesis of adaptive divergence due to coastal environmental heterogeneity in a connected metapopulation of a broadcast spawner.},

	abstract = {Dispersal and natural selection are key evolutionary processes shaping the distribution of phenotypic and genetic diversity. For species inhabiting complex spatial environments however, it is unclear how the balance between gene flow and selection may be influenced by landscape heterogeneity and environmental variation. Here, we evaluated the effects of dendritic landscape structure and the selective forces of hydroclimatic variation on population genomic parameters for the Murray River rainbowfish, Melanotaenia fluviatilis across the Murray–Darling Basin, Australia. We genotyped 249 rainbowfish at 17,503 high-quality SNP loci and integrated these with models of network connectivity and high-resolution environmental data within a riverscape genomics framework. We tested competing models of gene flow before using multivariate genotype–environment association (GEA) analysis to test for signals of adaptive divergence associated with hydroclimatic variation. Patterns of neutral genetic variation were consistent with expectations based on the stream hierarchy model and M. fluviatilis’ moderate dispersal ability. Models incorporating dendritic network structure suggested that landscape heterogeneity is a more important factor determining connectivity and gene flow than waterway distance. Extending these results, we also introduce a novel approach to controlling for the unique effects of dendritic network structure in GEA analyses of populations of aquatic species. We identified 146 candidate loci potentially underlying a polygenic adaptive response to seasonal fluctuations in stream flow and variation in the relative timing of temperature and precipitation extremes. Our findings underscore an emerging predominant role for seasonal variation in hydroclimatic conditions driving local adaptation and are relevant for informing proactive conservation management.},
