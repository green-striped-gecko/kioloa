##### Question

![](images/task.png){.class width="48" height="48"} Have you ever had problems reproducing your own or someone else’s research?

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| results: asis

# Define the questions
q1 <- "Have you ever had problems reproducing your own or someone else’s research?"


# Define the answer choices
q1_choices <- c(answer = "My own research", answer = "Someone else's",answer= "Both",answer= "I have never had problems reproducing r...")


cat(q1,longmcq(q1_choices))

```

### Things to consider when it comes to research

We will go through some of the practical steps for reproducible research:

## Quarto for Reproducibility

### Meet Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

### Meet the penguins

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/quarto-dev/quarto-web/main/docs/get-started/hello/rstudio/lter_penguins.png){style="float:right;" fig-alt="Illustration of three species of Palmer Archipelago penguins: Chinstrap, Gentoo, and Adelie. Artwork by @allison_horst." width="401"}

The `penguins` data from the [**palmerpenguins**](https://allisonhorst.github.io/palmerpenguins "palmerpenguins R package") package contains size measurements for `{r} nrow(penguins)` penguins from three species observed on three islands in the Palmer Archipelago, Antarctica.

The plot below shows the relationship between flipper and bill lengths of these penguins.

```{r}
#| label: plot-penguins
#| warning: false
#| echo: false

ggplot(penguins, 
       aes(x = flipper_length_mm, y = bill_length_mm)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = species, shape = species)) +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("darkorange","purple","cyan4")) +
  labs(
    title = "Flipper and bill length",
    subtitle = "Dimensions for penguins at Palmer Station LTER",
    x = "Flipper length (mm)", y = "Bill length (mm)",
    color = "Penguin species", shape = "Penguin species"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Quarto file

::: callout-note
## Exercise

![](images/task.png){#id .class width="48" height="48"} Download an example quarto file and try running it on your own.

```{css}
#| echo: false

.btn-default,
.btn-default:hover,
.btn-default:active {
  font-size: 20px;
  color: Grey;
  background-color: lightblue;
  border-color: black;
}

.btn-default:hover {
  color: grey;
  transition: 0.2s;
}

```

```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(downloadthis)

  download_file(path = './session04_code.qmd',
    output_name = "hello",
    output_extension = ".qmd",
    button_label = "Download hello.qmd",
    button_type = "default",
    has_icon = TRUE,
    icon = "fa fa-file-csv"
  )

```
